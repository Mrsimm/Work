# Work

My name is Troy Simmons, and I am a student at Athens State University. I am currently a senior pursuing a bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a concentration in Applied Information Technology and a minor in Cybersecurity.

Within this repository is a collection of my best coding work from all of my classes and personal projects.
